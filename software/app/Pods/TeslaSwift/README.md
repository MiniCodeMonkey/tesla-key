# TeslaSwift
Swift library to access the Tesla Model S API based on [Unofficial Tesla Model S API](http://docs.timdorr.apiary.io/#)

Installation
============

####Manual

Copy `Sources` folder into your project

####CocoaPods
```ruby
	pod 'TeslaSwift', '~> 3.0'
```
####Swift Package Manager
You can use [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) and specify a dependency in `Package.swift` by adding this:
```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/jonasman/TeslaSwift.git", majorVersion: 3)
```

Usage
============
Import the module
```swift
	import TeslaSwift
```

Perform an authentication with your My Tesla credentials: 
```swift 
let api = TeslaSwift()
api.authenticate(email: email, password: password)
```
Use the promise to check the success: 
```swift 
.then { (result) -> Void in
	
	//LogedIn!
	
}.catch { (error) in 
	print("Error: \(error as NSError)")			
}
```


Example
===========
```swift

class ViewController {

  func showCars() {

    api.getVehicles()
		.then { (response) -> Void in
			
			self.data = response
			self.tableView.reloadData()
			
		}.catch { (error) in
			//Process error
   }
}
```    

Options
============
You can use the mock server by setting: `api.useMockServer = true`

You can enable debugging by setting: `api.debuggingEnabled = true`

Other Features
============
After the authentication is done. The library manages itself the access token. 
When the token expires the library will perform another authentication with your past credentials.

Roadmap
